# Abstract 
With easy access to the internet in today's world, social media is easily accessible. People share lots of content there like blogs, tweets etc. The major concern is sharing news. Shared news spreads at a very fast pace among the people, it can be fake or real. Fake news can create a situation of chaos. So it is necessary to determine the news as fake or real as fast as possible. To address this issue, many approaches have been proposed using LSTM, CNN, RNN, Ensemble Learning Techniques etc but either they are too expensive in terms of computation power or their accuracy is low. In this paper, we present a novel approach to predict whether a news article is fake or not on the basis of the text and source or the speaker of the news. We proposed an ensemble learning based model to detect that has achieved a better accuracy. The model extracts the important features and uses them to classify the news. We have used basic machine learning models like Random Forest, Extra Tree Classifier and Decision Tree.  We achieved an accuracy of 95% on training and 65% on testing on the LIAR dataset.
